# chaithon
A new language having some components similar to Assembly interpreted in python, the language consists of 2 components- 1. Stack Memory: the complete code is revolving around a single stack upon which every command possible can be made, and 2.program memory, stored as tokens and traversed by a program counter that can either a)increment or b)jump if the top element in our stack is 0. I created this language in order to have a different approach towaards Computer Architecture and discover how to make it Turing complete even after having such a simple Architeture that I could simply create the Architecture in Hardware using ICs and Breadboards

to be able to run chaithon as one of my sample programs or create your own with ```.cy``` extension using simply cloning this repository using 

``` git clone https://github.com/chaitanyabatra/chaithon.git```

and going to the directory chaithon in your teminal and writing the following text

``` python3 chainterpreter.py [yourprogramname].cy```

I will try to create documentation for the same and keep updating this repository.
Thanks)
