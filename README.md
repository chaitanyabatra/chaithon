A new language having some components similar to Assembly interpreted in python, the language consists of 2 components- 1. Stack Memory: the complete code is revolving around a single stack upon which every command possible can be made, and 2.program memory, stored as tokens and traversed by a program counter that can either a)increment or b)jump if the top element in our stack is 0. I created this language in order to have a different approach towaards Computer Architecture and discover how to make it Turing complete even after having such a simple Architeture that I could simply create the Architecture in Hardware using ICs and Breadboards
